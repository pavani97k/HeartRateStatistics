# HeartRateStatistics
For a clinical trial, it is required to calculate some statistics for patients' heart rate data. The input “heartrate.json” file contains heart rate measurements collected by a patient over several days. Each measurement consists of beats per minute and timestamps when the measurement was taken (start and end timestamps).
